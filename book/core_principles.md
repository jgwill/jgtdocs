# Core Principles of the JGT Platform

This document outlines the foundational principles that guide all JGT packages. These principles ensure consistent behavior and unified development across the entire platform.

## Automation First
The platform prioritizes automated processes for signal detection, trade execution, and data management. Scripts and tooling should minimize manual steps wherever possible.

## Data Integrity
All data consumed or generated by the platform must remain verifiable and reproducible. Cached datasets should be referenced with clear paths, ensuring deterministic analysis across environments.

## CLI Transparency
Every major package provides a command-line interface. Users should be able to access help, run analyses, and execute tasks purely via CLI commands.

## Modular Design
Components must remain loosely coupled. Each module—whether jgtpy, jgtml, or jgtagentic—can operate independently yet integrate cleanly when orchestrated together.

## Documentation as Code
Documentation lives alongside the source. CLI guides, ledger files, and bridge timelines form a cohesive record of intent and evolution. Contributions must update these artifacts in sync with code changes.

## Market Facilitation Index (MFI)
The Market Facilitation Index (MFI) is a key indicator within the JGT Platform Ecosystem, measuring the efficiency of price movement per tick by relating price range to volume.

**MFI Signals (SQUAT):**
MFI generates four "SQUAT" signals based on combinations of MFI value and tick volume, each providing specific market insights and recommended actions:
* **Green (++)**: Both MFI and tick volume rise, indicating strong momentum. Traders can consider entering with the trend. The "Green Dragon Hunter" challenge involves entering a breakout when the Awesome Oscillator (AO) shows directional bias, aligning with strong momentum.
* **Fade (--)**: Both MFI and tick volume fall, signaling weakness and hesitation. Traders should pause or avoid new entries.
* **Fake (-+)**: High MFI but low tick volume, suggesting a "masked movement" or false breakout. Caution is advised, and traders should avoid entering. A "fake signal" on a larger timeframe may suggest staying out of the current timeframe.
* **Squat (+-)**: Volume is present but MFI is low, indicating energy building without expression, or consolidation. Traders should wait for clearer signals.

**MFI within the JGT Platform Ecosystem:**
* **Core Indicator**: MFI is listed as a core indicator in the JGTADS Charting Specification. It has dedicated data columns such as `mfi`, `mfi_val`, and specific SQUAT signals like `mfi_squat`, `mfi_green`, `mfi_fade`, and `mfi_fake` in JGTIDS.py and JGTCDS.py documentation.
* **Charting and Visualization**: The JGTADS charting system allows plotting MFI metrics.
* **Trading Strategies ("Spells")**:
    * **"The Oracle Crystal Reversal" (Spell #4)**: Uses Pink MFI bars (increasing volume, decreasing range) alongside Fractal Divergent Bars (FDB) and Tide Alligator lines to identify major reversals.
    * **"The Five Dimensions Alignment" (Spell #6)**: MFI contributes to the volume analysis for this high-probability strategy, which seeks alignment across five market dimensions.
    * MFI is also implicitly involved in developing "Market Wisdom" and "Advanced Enchantments" as traders learn to read market mood and combine indicators.
* **Signal Validation & Quality Assurance**: The JGTML platform uses MFI signals to help identify illusions and enhance signal quality. The "Enhanced FDB Scanner with Illusion Detection" achieved a high quality score, which MFI's "Fake" signal helps to detect.
* **Automated Workflow**: MFI calculations are part of `jgtpy`'s indicator generation. Its analysis is integrated into `jgtml` for multi-timeframe processing and signal validation.
* **Ongoing Research**: The platform continuously explores the implications of MFI signals across different timeframes to refine trading decisions, particularly regarding "Green" and "Fake" signals on higher degrees.
* **Resilient Analysis**: The "Resilient Pattern Guardian" feature ensures that analysis continues even if certain theoretical patterns, like "zonesq" (Zone Indicator + MFI Squat combination), are not yet fully implemented, demonstrating the system's adaptability.

In essence, MFI is a fundamental tool within the JGT Platform, providing crucial insights into market efficiency and momentum through its SQUAT signals, and is deeply integrated into the platform's analytical, strategic, and automated components for robust trading decisions.
