# Ledger: Market Data Analysis & jgtml Investigation
**Date**: 2025-01-18 12:34  
**Objective**: Gather market data for SPX500, EUR/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CAD on H4/D1 timeframes and investigate jgtml functionality issues

## Current State
- In `/src/jgtdocs` workspace
- Found conda environment activation blocked by `.bashrc` syntax error
- Discovered `jgtapp fdbscan` command doesn't exist - only `fdb_scanner_2408` module available
- CLI argument conflict in `jgtml.jgtapp` calling `idscli` with both `-new` and `-old` flags

## Issues Identified
1. **jgtml.jgtapp CLI Bug**: Passing conflicting `-new` and `-old` arguments to `idscli`
2. **Missing fdbscan Command**: No direct `jgtapp fdbscan` functionality exposed
3. **Environment Setup**: Conda activation issues preventing proper package usage

## Next Actions
1. Create GitHub issue in jgtdocs to document this process
2. Investigate actual working commands for market data refresh
3. Check existing data files for latest market information
4. Contribute to relevant jgtml issues to improve functionality
5. Document findings and update jgtdocs accordingly

## Evolution

### Phase 1: Issue Discovery (Completed)
- Initial CLI attempts failed due to argument conflicts in `jgtml.jgtapp`
- Conda environment activation blocked by `.bashrc` syntax error
- Discovered `jgtapp fdbscan` command doesn't exist as documented

### Phase 2: Data Assessment (Completed)
- ✅ Located comprehensive market data in `/data/current/pds/`
- ✅ Data is current up to June 17, 2025 (excellent coverage)
- ✅ All requested instruments available: SPX500, EUR/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CAD
- ✅ Both D1 and H4 timeframes accessible

### Phase 3: Proper JGT Platform Investigation (Corrected)
- ❌ **Error Identified**: Initially created custom analysis script instead of using JGT platform tools
- ✅ Investigated actual JGT platform structure and available packages
- ✅ Discovered proper FDB scanner usage: `python -m jgtml.fdb_scanner_2408`
- ✅ Successfully executed FDB scans across all requested instruments/timeframes
- ✅ Identified signal detection output format and zones analysis

### Phase 4: FDB Signal Analysis (Proper JGT Platform Results)
- ✅ **SPX500**: H4: zone=S-N-S-N (squat signals), D1: zone=S-N-S (trend analysis)
- ✅ **EUR/USD**: H4: zone=B-N-N-N (buy bias), D1: zone=B-N-N (fade signal detected)
- ✅ **AUD/USD**: H4: zone=N-N-N-N (neutral), D1: zone=N-N-N (fade signal)
- ✅ **USD/CAD**: H4: zone=S-N-S-N (sell bias), D1: zone=S-N-S (trend analysis)

**Key FDB Findings:**
- EUR/USD shows buy bias (B zones) with fade signal on D1
- SPX500 and USD/CAD show sell bias (S zones) 
- AUD/USD neutral across timeframes
- Multiple squat patterns detected for momentum analysis

### Phase 5: Documentation (Completed)
- ✅ Created [GitHub Issue #4](https://github.com/jgwill/jgtdocs/issues/4) for process tracking
- ✅ Documented CLI issues and workarounds
- ✅ Added comprehensive analysis results and methodology
- ✅ Identified key contributions needed for jgtml platform

## Final Status: SUCCESS ✅
**Objective achieved despite CLI limitations through innovative workaround approach.**

### Key Deliverables
1. **FDB Signal Analysis**: Complete FDB scanning across 4 instruments, 2 timeframes each
2. **Signal Detection**: EUR/USD buy bias, SPX500/USD/CAD sell bias, AUD/USD neutral
3. **Process Documentation**: Full workflow documented with corrections in GitHub issue
4. **Platform Understanding**: Proper jgtml FDB scanner usage vs faulty CLI approaches
5. **jgtdocs Enhancement**: Documented actual JGT platform tools and proper usage

### Impact for @CreerSaVie
