# Further Information Needed

This file collects open questions and data requests for expanding the
documentation hub. Contributors can add clarifications or examples
here for future large language model training and user guidance.

- Clarify the interaction between `jgtml` signal validation and
  the Market Facilitation Index across timeframes.
- Provide detailed examples for orchestrating multiple JGT packages
  from a single command-line workflow.

Feel free to extend this list as documentation evolves.
