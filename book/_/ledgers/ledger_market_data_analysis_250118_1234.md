# Ledger: Market Data Analysis & jgtml Investigation
**Date**: 2025-01-18 12:34  
**Objective**: Gather market data for SPX500, EUR/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CAD on H4/D1 timeframes and investigate jgtml functionality issues

## Current State
- In `/src/jgtdocs` workspace
- Found conda environment activation blocked by `.bashrc` syntax error
- Discovered `jgtapp fdbscan` command doesn't exist - only `fdb_scanner_2408` module available
- CLI argument conflict in `jgtml.jgtapp` calling `idscli` with both `-new` and `-old` flags

## Issues Identified
1. **jgtml.jgtapp CLI Bug**: Passing conflicting `-new` and `-old` arguments to `idscli`
2. **Missing fdbscan Command**: No direct `jgtapp fdbscan` functionality exposed
3. **Environment Setup**: Conda activation issues preventing proper package usage

## Next Actions
1. Create GitHub issue in jgtdocs to document this process
2. Investigate actual working commands for market data refresh
3. Check existing data files for latest market information
4. Contribute to relevant jgtml issues to improve functionality
5. Document findings and update jgtdocs accordingly

## Evolution
- Initial attempt failed due to CLI bugs
- Need to understand actual working data pipeline
- Focus on existing data analysis rather than refresh attempts
