🧪 Codex Invocation Scratchpad – Updated Notes

Desires forming:
- Implement FDB Scanner to use real signal detection (no simulation)
- Connect `intent_spec.py` to enhanced parsing logic
- Validate signal output using intent alignment and quality scoring
- Enable CLI invocation via `jgtagenticcli.py`
- Represent MFI signals visually (color-coded, glyph-based)
- Support recommendation generation from scanner phase
- Align signal output with external strategy structure (YAML)

📍 Signal Pattern Module: Alligator Illusion Detection

Name: Alligator Illusion Detection  
Intent: Detect false-positive trade entries when lower timeframes appear to trend but contradict broader market structure.

Scope of Awareness:
- Visual trigger begins on m15 (movement appears promising).
- Confirm alignment not only with H1 and H4, but escalate validation to D1, W1, and MN1 (supercycle structure).
- These higher timeframes determine campaign potential—short vs. long term engagement.

Components to Detect:
- Alligator mouth status on each timeframe.
- How long the mouth has been closed (“hunger” of the Alligator).
- Angulation: price diverging sharply from Alligator’s balance lines.
- Elliott Wave Position: current wave vs. alternate count.
  - Determine whether current wave is nearing end.
  - Recognize final wave formations hidden in smaller trends.

Signal Type:
- Visual overlay + verbal alert if mismatch is detected.
- Guidance on campaign duration based on supercycle alignment.

🌀 Observation Loop: Campaign Readiness Awareness Module

Concept: Create a voice-driven observational module that records the trader’s live chart impressions across multiple timeframes, providing stored data to guide agent validation of signals.

🌿 Key Observations:
- Pattern archetype: Signals appear promising on smaller timeframes (like m15), but contradict longer-wave structures, indicating the need for caution.
- Entry timing is optimal at the transition point between larger wave completion and the start of a new impulse wave.
  - For example, after wave 2 ends (at its C-leg), or end of wave 4 before wave 5.
- Desire to avoid false entries during smaller wave movements that actually belong to the tail of a larger correction.

🧭 Multi-Timeframe Perception:
- Voice synthesis captures a full-frame read of one instrument across m15, H1, H4, D1, W1, MN1 in about 30 seconds.
- Descriptive output stores a semantic memory of market state that agents can draw upon.
- This includes Elliott wave count and alternate count descriptions.
- Not intended for rigid rules—serves as intent shading and signal context.

🎚 Signal Enrichment:
- Combine higher-timeframe signal values (e.g. Alligator mouth status) as columns added to a lower timeframe data row.
- Aligns signals on a single frame with inherited higher-level context.
- Supports multi-dimensional state awareness.

🔮 Buzzword Rejection:
- Caution against oversimplified terms like “bullish/bearish sentiment.”
- Emphasis instead on nuanced pattern language rooted in timewave and indicator relations.

Emerging Field: **Campaign Readiness Awareness**
This field interweaves bodily intuition, visual resonance, and structured temporal logic to prepare or filter agent signal actions.

Stored and ready for next phase.
