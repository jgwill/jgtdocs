# Agent Notes

This repository is maintained through collaborative agent workflows. Each commit includes ledger entries summarizing the intent and emotional context.

## Guidelines
- Record ledger files in `codex/ledgers/` with timestamps.
- Maintain `narrative-map.md` to outline commit history and evolving objectives.
- Use `bridge/<date>/` directories for chronological notes and timelines.
- Retrieve relevant memory keys via `tushell` to incorporate prior work into
  timelines and ledgers.
- Verify `jgtpy`, `jgtml`, and `jgtagentic` CLI helpers with cached data paths
  before documenting changes.
