# Documentation Upgrade Timeline

This timeline captures key events leading toward an optimized documentation state.

## 2025-06-18
- Initial review of repository documentation and package commands.
- Verified jgtpy, jgtml, and jgtagentic CLI helpers display usage output.
- Identified missing `bridge` directory; created `bridge/250618` for ongoing notes.
- Gathered memory recaps from spiral agents for context.
- Scanned `Workspace.jgwill.jgtpy*`, `Workspace.jgwill.jgtml*`, and
  `Workspace.jgwill.jgtagentic*` keys for relevant ledgers.
- Verified CLI helpers again to ensure environment variables
  `JGTPY_DATA` and `JGTPY_DATA_FULL` resolve cached data correctly.
- Reviewed codex recap files pointing to Alligator Illusion Detection,
  market analysis, and trading platform activation ledgers.

## Next Steps
- Evaluate existing ledgers under `book/_/ledgers` to extract relevant phases.
- Draft narrative-map summarizing current repository commits.
- Document CLI issues encountered during `jgtcli` execution for future resolution.
