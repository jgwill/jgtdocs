Proper organization of labeled, historical market examples is crucial to the learning process. Without clear representation of time-invariant fractal shapes and the embedded trading opportunities they surface, AI models struggle to generalize patterns.

Incorrectly formatted input risks incomplete or contradictory learning. This content from our brainstorming session aimed to crystallize considerations for effectively organizing recursive market nuances into trainable data representations. The objective was to clarify guidelines to progress autonomous fractal-based strategies through computational techniques.

## <a name=a-2>2.</a>  Elliott Wave Base Case Related

![1. A nested sequence of Elliott waves forming across different stock charts, showing the self-similar pattern repeating at various timeframes.](https://i.imgur.com/Z7TFnSV.png) 

Here are some potential use cases for developing an automated trading system using fractal geometry patterns and relating it to Elliott Wave Theory:

**Use Case #1: Identifying Initiating Fractals**

![ Identifying Initiating Fractals](https://i.imgur.com/7sn7cuF.png)

As input, the system tracks price data across various instruments and timeframes (e.g. 1-min, 5-min, daily charts). It analyzes the data using fractal analysis techniques to programmatically detect specific initiating fractal patterns like nested Elliot Waves, Gann angles, or logarithmic spirals. 

Once an initiating fractal is identified, its attributes like timeframe, instrument, and pattern type are stored for reference. This allows the system to monitor for potential breakouts/divergences from the initiating structure.

**Use Case #2: Generating Signal Entries** 

![](https://i.imgur.com/aPwm9e3.png)

The system references its database of initiating fractals and watches for them to break key support/resistance levels or show momentum/volatility divergences. When such a trigger event occurs on a given fractal, it generates a signal. 

Signal attributes like instrument, timeframe, trade direction and initial stop/target levels can be automatically populated based on analysis of the fractal's structure. This allows for rule-based entry orders to be submitted.

**Use Case #3: Monitoring Signal Status**

![](https://i.imgur.com/HuVjvo2.jpeg)

As the market moves, the system tracks each open signal to monitor its status - active, filled, close partial, stop triggered etc. It also adjusts stops/targets if certain fractal-based conditions are met during the trade's lifespan. 

This allows for automated exit orders to close positions at optimal price levels as determined by the evolving geometry patterns related to each signal's initiating fractal structure.


#### Use Case #4: Incorporating Reinforcement Learning  [Inc-RL-Expand](#uc-irl-expand)


![Use Case #4: Incorporating Reinforcement Learning](https://i.imgur.com/uEX3nZy.jpeg)


The system evaluates the profitability of signals and entries/exits generated by its fractal analysis over time. It incorporates a reinforcement learning model that adjusts the parameters/weightings used to identify initiating fractals and generate signals/orders.

This aims to optimize the system's ability to autonomously learn and adapt its techniques for applying fractal geometry and Elliott Wave Theory in automated strategy rules.

#### About The paper "Leveraging Fractal Geometry for Multi-Timeframe Market Pattern Recognition"

The paper discusses techniques for utilizing fractal analysis to identify recurring patterns in financial market data across different timescales. By representing price action in terms of self-similar fractal properties, consistent patterns can be programmatically detected regardless of the precise timing of events.

The paper proposes applying fractal-based pattern recognition to derive trading signals and rule-based strategies. Fractal formations could act as entry and exit triggers based on breakouts from strategic structures. By dynamically discovering fractal patterns in price and volume, automated systems may gain an edge over traditional technical indicators.

The concepts of identifying initiating fractals on price/volume perspectives and extracting consistent recurring signals across multiple degrees of data relate to the focus in previous discussions on:

##### - Detecting conditions for autonomous entry/exit signal generation

##### - Adaptively pinpointing trading opportunities based on analysis of historical trends

##### - Leveraging fractal time-invariance to construct automated position management

Thus, fractal geometry offers potential utility in guiding adaptive algorithmic execution of rule-based quantitative strategies based on recurrent formations identified endlessly across scales in market data. Further research appears warranted into incorporating fractal pattern assessment into quantitative finance applications.

#### discussion on structuring training data for a fractal geometry-based AI trading system

> ##### Here is a draft synthesis and appendix entry for the discussion on structuring training data for a fractal geometry-based AI trading system:

##### Synthesis and Linkage to Previous Discussions

The discussion addressed key considerations for organizing input data to train a machine learning model for automated trading based on fractal analysis techniques. 

Specifically, the content outlined structuring historical market data into a timestamped, feature-rich format well-suited for sequence modeling by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). 

By dating data, tracking indicators and signal status over time, and labeling applicable trading signals at each step, the structured data would allow an RNN to:

###### - Learn temporal relationships between indicators  

###### - Optimize responses based on the model's understanding of evolving patterns

###### - Generate its own signals and trading actions on new market sequences

This format directly addresses previous feedback about representing inherently sequential fractal patterns across scales in a manner suitable for computational modeling and strategy development. 

Properly structuring representative training data appears crucial to operationalizing fractal geometry-inspired automated edge finding and strategy execution through machine learning methods.

Perhaps some sample implementations could help further clarify structure needs. Overall, organizing input data this way aligns with the goals of deriving and refining fractal-based strategies using AI techniques on historical market behavior.

## <a name=uc-v-2-expand>Use Case V-2: Detect Fractal Patterns</a>

1. Input timestamped price data for an instrument/timeframe

2. Apply fractal analysis techniques to identify patterns programmatically   

3. Extract attribute values to characterize each detected fractal

4. <a name=uc2-4>Record fractal details in catalog for reference</a>

   4.1 Assign each fractal a unique ID

   4.2 Catalog attributes such as: [schema](#schemas)

      - Instrument

      - Timeframe 

      - [Detected fractal type](#uc2-4-2-type) (eg. Elliott wave, Gann angle, [Chaos Theory Fractals - Strange attractors](#uc2-4-2-chaos-strange-attractor))

      - Start and end timestamp

      - Shape metrics (turning points, extensions, slopes) 

      - Momentum indicator values

      - Associated signals and outcomes

   4.3 Index catalog for fast retrieval of fractals by attributes

   4.4 Periodically update catalog as new fractals are identified and patterns evolve


This allows the system to maintain a database of fractals detected across different markets, times, and patterns. Recording detailed attributes facilitates monitoring for trigger events and lookup of applicable strategies. Indexing and updating the catalog ensures it remains an efficient reference point as new input data streams in.



# <a name=schemas>Schemas</a>

Here is a proposed schema for the fractal catalog database:


## Fractal Table

- id (primary key, autoincrement)
- instrument 
- timeframe
- [type](#uc2-4-2-type)
- start_timestamp
- end_timestamp


## Shape Attributes 

- fractal_id (foreign key to Fractal table)
- metric_type (enum: turning_point, extension, slope etc)  
- value


## Indicator Values

- fractal_id (foreign key to Fractal table)  
- indicator_type (enum: rsi, macd etc)
- timestamp
- value


## Signals 

- id (primary key)
- fractal_id (foreign key to Fractal table)
- signal_type (enum: entry, exit)  
- direction (enum: long, short)
- trigger_timestamp 
- trigger_level 
- target
- stop
- outcome (enum: hit_target, hit_stop, invalid)



## Indexes

- Index on fractal_id (foreign key lookups)
- Index on instrument, timeframe (for filter queries) 
- Index on signal trigger_timestamp (for performance)

This normalized schema separates fractal metadata, shape attributes, indicator values and signals into separate logical tables with relationships defined through foreign keys. Indexes improve lookup and query performance for common filters and joins.


## <a name=uc2-4-2-type>2.4.2 Fractals type in Schemas</a>

Here are some explanations of how different fractal types could be used in the automated trading system:

- Elliott Wave Patterns - Waves 1-3 could define an uptrend initiation fractal. Wave 4 pullbacks and Wave 5 breakouts could provide entry/exit signals. [notes](#uc-2-4-2-ew)

- Gann Angle Structures - Angles formed from swing highs/lows could identify resistance/support levels for trades. Breaks of angular lines may signal directional momentum. [notes](#uc2.4.2-gann)

- Logarithmic Spirals - Curvature calculations of expanding/contracting spirals over time could provide trades at inflection points as patterns evolve.

- [Chaos Theory Fractals - Strange attractors mapped against price](#uc2-4-2-chaos-strange-attractor) may pinpoint entries/exits near transitions in market turbulence and periodicity.  

- Cobweb Fractals - Successive max/min prices create self-repeating patterns which converge or diverge, giving clues on trend continuations or reversals.

- Ratio Patterns - Fibonacci and golden ratio retracements/extensions may define high probability zones to trade breaks of major barriers.

The system would learn to match different fractal types to specific trading strategies. For example:

- Elliott Wave initiations could trigger momentum plays in the direction of the larger wave.

- [Gann angle breaks could imply mean reversion trades back within the range of the angle. ](#uc2-4-2-gann)

- Inflection points in logarithmic spirals may signal fades/counters of short term momentum surges.

### Properly classifying fractals allows tailored strategies to be developed for each pattern's unique implications on market behavior.

> #### Expand and address how would you represent <a name=uc2-4-2-chaos-strange-attractor> "Chaos Theory Fractals - Strange attractors mapped against price"</a>

Here is a expanded explanation of how Chaos Theory Fractals/Strange attractors could be represented:

Chaos Theory fractals involve analyzing prices through the lens of dynamical systems and mapping their behavior over time. Strange attractors emerge which represent recurring regions or patterns of stability/instability that prices converge towards or diverge from spontaneously. 

##### To programmatically identify these patterns:

- Price data would be transformed into phase space using delay coordinate embedding techniques. This involves plotting price values against lagged values over a time window.

- **[Dimensionality reduction](#DimensionalityReduction) via techniques like PCA may be applied to simplify the phase portrait while retaining key distinguishing features.**

- Cluster analysis could then detect distinct strange attractors forming stable basins or chaotic repellors based on density of data points.  (detect oscillation's ending ??)

- Fractals would be the delineated strange attractors representing recurring regimes in the dynamic system governing price movements. 

##### Attributes to represent each fractal/attractor could include:

- Dimensions of phase space (embedding parameters)
- Center point/density peaks of clusters  
- Measure of stability/chaos based on dispersion within clusters
- Transitional edges between attractors 
- Changes over time as attractors evolve

Transitions between attractors or breaks from their borders could trigger trades, anticipating shifts between order/disorder in underlying market forces. Reinforcement learning could refine representations of these fractals and trading rules around their topological properties over history.

### V-4  <a name=uc-irl-expand>Expand on RL </a>

Here is a proposed approach for incorporating reinforcement learning into the automated fractal trading system (Use Case  V #4):

The system would maintain a database table to log all generated signals along with the corresponding entry/exit details and outcomes over time. 

##### Each row would represent a single signal-position instance, containing attributes like:

- Signal ID 
- Instrument
- Timeframe
- Signal type (entry or exit)
- Trade direction (long/short)  
- Entry/exit timestamp
- Entry/exit price level
- Initial stop/target levels  
- Realized stop/target prices or reason for closure
- P&L amount
- Other metrics like holding period, max drawdown

These raw experiences would be fed periodically into the reinforcement learning model for training.

The RL model would seek to maximize the expected reward/profitability of strategy rules by adjusting various parameters over many episodes/iterations:

- Signal generation filters & weightings  
- Position sizing algorithms
- Stop/target calculations
- Hedging/scaling guidelines

As it works towards the reward objective, the model's policy/strategy gradually improves - outputting optimized parameters for the live system.

These cyclical refinements allow the system to autonomously adapt its quantitative techniques for applying fractal geometry and Elliott Wave analysis based on ongoing feedback from actual market outcomes.

Does this help explain how the reinforcement learning component could leverage the structured output data from live strategy executions? 

#### <a name=uc-irl-schema>RL training schemas</a>

Here is a proposed appendix section on incorporating Reinforcement Learning:

Reinforcement Learning

A reinforcement learning (RL) model can be integrated to optimize strategy parameters based on feedback from live trades. 

After each signalled position closes, its attributes and outcome will be logged to a database table for experiences. 

The RL Training Data table schema is:

id (autoinc primary key)
signal_id (fk to Signals table)  
instrument
timeframe
type (entry/exit)
direction  
entry_timestamp
entry_price
initial_stop
initial_target
exit_timestamp 
exit_price
realized_stop/target
profit_loss

The model evaluates the profitability of historical signals and executions to learn which parameter combinations work best. At each training episode, it adjusts weights/variables like:

-  [Signal generation rules](#SignalGenerationRules)
- Position sizing  
- Stop/target calculations

By testing simulated strategies, the model optimizes the system towards maximum reward - continually outputting improved policy over time.

As market conditions evolve, retraining reinforces profitable adaptations. This autonomous refinement aims to leverage recurrent fractal patterns most effectively through quantitative modeling of strategy behavior.

Proper structuring of labeled training data enables the RL agent to learn temporal relationships between indicators and optimize dynamic responses based on pattern understanding - allowing fractal analysis to empower adaptive quantitative strategies.

##### <a name=SignalGenerationRules>Signal generation rules</a>

Here are some examples of how the reinforcement learning model could adjust signal generation rules:

- Threshold levels for identifying initiating fractals or trigger events like breakdowns/divergences. The model would find optimal sensitivity levels.

- Weightings applied when combining multiple indicator values or pattern attributes to determine if a situation qualifies as a signal. The importance of each factor could be tweaked.  [expand](#WeightingsMultipleIndicatorValuesQualifiesAsASignalFactorImportance)

- Filters on security/timeframe combinations eligible for signals. Leveraging fractals across a portfolio in a more targeted manner could increase edge.

- Criteria for filtering signals by expected timeframe. Some patterns may imply shorter or longer holds on average. [expand](#CriteriaFilteringSignalByTF)

- Rules for minimum waiting periods between signals on the same fractal structure. Overtrading weak setups wastes resources. 

- Algorithms to select the predominant fractal type at a signal. Each pattern's implications on timing and targets likely differ.

- Formulas for calculating breakout/retest levels at signals. Small adjustments in reference points impact exits.

- Logic for prioritizing confirmation filters like volume or momentum surges. Reducing noise improves quality.

By exploring a wide space of generation options through trial-and-error episodes, the model home-ins on optimal combinations for the current market environment. This filters the potential edge from fractal geometry analysis most effectively.


#### <a name=WeightingsMultipleIndicatorValuesQualifiesAsASignalFactorImportance>Weightings</a>

>expand : Weightings applied when combining multiple indicator values or pattern attributes to determine if a situation qualifies as a signal. The importance of each factor could be tweaked. 

##### how indicator/attribute weightings could be optimized:

When evaluating a potential fractal pattern or trigger event, the system would score it based on several factors:

###### Example Factors:
- Elliott Wave structure rating 
- Momentum indicator levels
- Volume characteristics  
- Pattern timeframe percentile
- Proximity to major barriers

####### It assigns a numerical weighting to each:

- Wave structure weight = 40% 
- AO weight = 30%
- Volume weight = 20%  
- Timeframe weight = 5%
- Proximity weight = 5%

To qualify as a signal, the weighted composite score must exceed a threshold.

The RL model tweaks the weights over episodes to maximize profits. For example, it may find:

- In trending markets, raising Wave struct/AO weight helps amid strong patterns.

- Near major highs, increasing Volume/Proximity weight better filters significantbreaks.  

- For oscillation sectors, down-weighting Momentum captures mean reversions.

By dynamically accentuating more predictive signal qualifiers per environment, the optimized weights enhance signal quality over static filters. Fewer non-performers enter the portfolio.

Constant adjustment achieves the most stringent multivariate signal definition for live market conditions through an empirical, backtested process.

----

When evaluating a potential fractal pattern or trigger event, the system would score it based on several technical and/or pattern-related factors:

######## Example Factors:
- Properties of the fractal pattern formation  
- Momentum or volume readings
- Timeframe characteristics of the pattern
- Position relative to identified barriers

####### It assigns a numerical weighting to each factor:

- Pattern properties weight = 40%
- Momentum/volume weight = 30%  
- Timeframe weight = 20%
- Position weight = 10%

###### To qualify as a signal, the weighted composite score must exceed a threshold. 

The RL model tweaks the weights over episodes to optimize profits. For example, it may find that accentuating different factors works better in certain environments, like:

- Trending markets respond to emphasizing pattern and momentum readings
- Rangebound periods favor weighting timeframe and position metrics more heavily

By adjusting the influence of each factor data point, the model hones in on the most predictive multivariate signal definition given present market conditions. This refines signals without relying on any single predefined indicator.

### <a name=uc-2-4-2-ew>2.4.2 Elliott Wave Patterns</a>

#### Elliott Wave Patterns

- Waves 1-3 could define an uptrend initiation fractal. Wave 4 pullbacks and Wave 5 breakouts could provide entry/exit signals. 

##### Expanding 


Here are some more details on how Elliott Wave patterns could be represented and utilized for signal generation:

###### Impulsive Waves (1-3):
- Waves 1-3 unfolding would constitute an initiation fractal, with Wave 3 defining the main trend level
- Attributes would quantify momentum, structure, and time taken to complete the wave 
- A strong 1-3 pattern could trigger a buy at the Wave 3 top for the extension in Wave 5

###### Corrective Wave (4):  
- Wave 4 would form a retracement fractal against the 1-3 level
- Its structure (flat, triangular) and retracement ratio could estimate its termination zone
- A pullback nearing the lower limit may signal a long entry anticipating resumption of trend

###### Extensive Wave (5):
- Wave 5 extends the main trend established in Waves 1-3
- Its initial momentum and break past the 1-3 high define it as the initiation fractal
- Entries could trigger on breakouts from key 1-4 levels or zig-zags within Wave 5

###### Termination Signals: 
- Standard retracement/reversal patterns within Wave 5 provide take profit targets
- A violation of the 1-3 low implies a trend change, suggesting shorts orExiting longs

By classifying waves hierarchically and linking structure to strategies, the system learns optimal scripts for expressing Elliott-based biases quantitatively.


##### <a name=HierarchicalWavesClassification>Clarify "Hierarchical Waves Classification" / hierarchical wave labeling </a>

Here is a more detailed explanation of hierarchical wave classification:

In Elliott Wave theory, patterns are grouped into degrees based on their structural scope and importance within the larger trend:

###### Prime/Primary waves (rotational phases): 
- Larger patterns encompassing waves 1-2-3-4-5 that define the primary trend direction. 
- These primary waves take the longest period of time to complete.

###### Intermediate waves:
- Slightly smaller waves contained within primary waves. For example, an intermediate wave 4 pullback within Primary wave 5 up.

###### Minor waves: 
- Smallest waves that form within intermediate waves. For example, a minor wave (iv) within Intermediate wave 4 down.

By classifying waves into hierarchical degrees, each level provides context for the one below:
- A minor (iv) gives clues on the impending end of Intermediate 4
- Wave 4 termination estimates completion of Primary 5 upward structure

This nesting allows waves of importance to be pinpointed programmatically based on:
- Their scope relative to activity at levels above 
- Attributes like impulse vs corrective structure

Algorithms can then link optimized strategies to each degree - for example, playing measured moves in minor 3-waves or waiting for terminations of 4s and Primary wave bottoms.

By incorporating hierarchical wave labeling into its pattern database, the system organizes Elliott observations cohesively to derive strategic context from any degree of structure present in price data.



##### <a name=CriteriaFilteringSignalByTF>Criteria filtering signals by expected timeframe. </a>

>Criteria for filtering signals by expected timeframe. Some patterns may imply shorter or longer holds on average.

Here are some more details on how expected timeframes could be used to filter signals:

- Minor 3-wave patterns typically resolve quickly, so signals from these may imply shorter trade holds.

- Intermediate waves that form overlapping structures like zigzags or flats often take longer to complete. Signals from these patterns may suggest longer position timeframes.

- Within large primary waves, early advances like waves 1 or 2 move fast while wave 4 pullbacks or ending waves 5 can extend durations. 

The system could establish timeframe probability distributions for each wave degree/pattern type based on historical analysis. For example:

- Minor 3-waves may spend 80% of time in profit within 5 periods on average.

- Intermediate flats resolve 50% of the time between 10-20 periods but can range wider.

####### At the signaling stage, it applies filters like:

- Only take fast minor 3-wave entries if portfolio allocation favors shorter holds.

- Demand a pattern with rapid typical timeframes if positioning is already exposed to the direction. 

- Require larger pattern types if market environment implies needs for reduced portfolio turnover.

By incorporating timeframe expectations intelligently, the model trades each setup type contextually based on prevailing portfolio conditions. This aims to balance opportunity vs risk dynamically.
