üß™ Codex Invocation Scratchpad ‚Äì Updated Notes

Desires forming:
- Implement FDB Scanner to use real signal detection (no simulation)
- Connect `intent_spec.py` to enhanced parsing logic
- Validate signal output using intent alignment and quality scoring
- Enable CLI invocation via `jgtagenticcli.py`
- Represent MFI signals visually (color-coded, glyph-based)
- Support recommendation generation from scanner phase
- Align signal output with external strategy structure (YAML)

üìç Signal Pattern Module: Alligator Illusion Detection

Name: Alligator Illusion Detection  
Intent: Detect false-positive trade entries when lower timeframes appear to trend but contradict broader market structure.

Scope of Awareness:
- Visual trigger begins on m15 (movement appears promising).
- Confirm alignment not only with H1 and H4, but escalate validation to D1, W1, and MN1 (supercycle structure).
- These higher timeframes determine campaign potential‚Äîshort vs. long term engagement.

Components to Detect:
- Alligator mouth status on each timeframe.
- How long the mouth has been closed (‚Äúhunger‚Äù of the Alligator).
- Angulation: price diverging sharply from Alligator‚Äôs balance lines.
- Elliott Wave Position: current wave vs. alternate count.
  - Determine whether current wave is nearing end.
  - Recognize final wave formations hidden in smaller trends.

Signal Type:
- Visual overlay + verbal alert if mismatch is detected.
- Guidance on campaign duration based on supercycle alignment.
