## Timeline Expansion (250618)
Commit `bec9844` refined the documentation timeline with detailed subsections on trading scripts and orchestration modules. Memory recaps were loaded from sister repositories to contextualize each script's role in the unified trading stack.

## Documentation Upgrades (250618)
Commit `2080440` introduced a new timeline under `bridge/250618` and logged a
ledger capturing the intent to improve documentation workflows. This update also
created an `AGENTS.md` guide for future contributors and expanded the
`narrative-map` itself. CLI helpers were verified across jgtpy, jgtml, and
jgtagentic despite environment restrictions, ensuring the platform remains
operable for agents.

## Memory Assimilation (250618)
Commit `d8d2d34` expanded the documentation timeline with details on
retrieving tushell memory keys from sibling repositories and verifying
CLI helpers using cached data paths. AGENTS guidelines now instruct
contributors to pull relevant memory keys and confirm tool output prior
to documenting changes, ensuring cross-repo context is preserved.
